# Infrahub schema: BGP Session for Synapse project
# Uses the schema-library routing_bgp extension directly
# This file documents the schema dependency chain for the project
#
# Load order (handled by infrahub/schemas/load_schemas.py):
#   1. library/schema-library/extensions/vrf/vrf.yml          -> IpamVRF, IpamRouteTarget
#   2. library/schema-library/extensions/routing/routing.yml   -> RoutingProtocol (generic)
#   3. library/schema-library/extensions/routing_bgp/bgp.yml   -> RoutingAutonomousSystem, RoutingBGPPeerGroup, RoutingBGPSession
#   4. infrahub/schemas/network_device.yml                     -> DcimDevice extensions (management_ip, lab_node_name, asn)
#   5. infrahub/schemas/network_interface.yml                  -> InterfacePhysical extensions (role)
#
# The routing_bgp extension provides:
#   - RoutingAutonomousSystem: ASN with name, number, organization, location, devices
#   - RoutingBGPPeerGroup: Reusable BGP peer group parameters
#   - RoutingBGPSession: Point-to-point BGP session with local/remote AS, IPs, device, peer_group
#   - Extension to DcimGenericDevice: adds 'asn' relationship
#   - Extension to OrganizationGeneric: adds 'asn' relationship
#
# No additional custom BGP schema needed — the schema-library extension covers our use case.
# This file is kept as documentation of the schema architecture.
