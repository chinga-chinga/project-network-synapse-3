# Infrahub schema extension: Network Interface customizations for Synapse project
# This extends the base InterfacePhysical with project-specific attributes
# Base InterfacePhysical already provides: name, description, enabled, speed, mtu, device relationship, etc.
#
# Dependencies: base schemas (dcim) must be loaded first
